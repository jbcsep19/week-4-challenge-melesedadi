    <h3>What is Java?</h3>
    <p>September 27, 2019</p>
    <P>
        Java is a programming language and a computing platform for application development. It was first released by Sun Microsystem in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is one of the most used programming languages.
        Java platform is a collection of programs that help to develop and run programs written in the Java programming language. Java platform includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries. JAVA is platform-independent language. It is not specific to any processor or operating system.

    <h3>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) & its Architecture</h3>
    <p>September 27, 2019</p>
    <p>
        JVM is a engine that provides runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It converts Java bytecode into machines language. JVM is a part of JRE(Java Run Environment). It stands for Java Virtual Machine

        In other programming languages, the compiler produces machine code for a particular system. However, Java compiler produces code for a Virtual Machine known as Java Virtual Machine.
        First, Java code is complied into bytecode. This bytecode gets interpreted on different machines
        Between host system and Java source, Bytecode is an intermediary language.
        JVM is responsible for allocating memory space.</p>

<h4>JVM Architecture </h4>
        </p> Let's understand the Architecture of JVM. It contains classloader, memory area, execution engine etc.
    Working of Java Virtual Machine(JVM) & its Architecture.</p>
        <img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/2.png">

    <ol>
    <li>ClassLoader</li>

        <p>The class loader is a subsystem used for loading class files. It performs three major functions viz. Loading, Linking, and Initialization.

    </p>
    <li> Method Area</li>

    <p>JVM Method Area stores class structures like metadata, the constant runtime pool, and the code for methods.

    </p>
    <li> Heap</li>

    <p>All the Objects, their related instance variables, and arrays are stored in the heap. This memory is common and shared across multiple threads.

</p>
    <li>JVM language Stacks</li>

    <p> Java language Stacks store local variables, and itâ€™s partial results. Each thread has its own JVM stack, created simultaneously as the thread is created. A new frame is created whenever a method is invoked, and it is deleted when method invocation process is complete.

</p>
    <li>PC Registers</li>

    <p> PC register store the address of the Java virtual machine instruction which is currently executing. In Java, each thread has its separate PC register.

</p>
    <li> Native Method Stacks</li>

    <p>Native method stacks hold the instruction of native code depends on the native library. It is written in another language instead of Java.

</p>
    <li>Execution Engine</li>

    <p>It is a type of software used to test hardware, software, or complete systems. The test execution engine never carries any information about the tested product.

</p>
    <li>Native Method interface </li>

    <p>The Native Method Interface is a programming framework. It allows Java code which is running in a JVM to call by libraries and native applications.
